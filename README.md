# CP104 Programming II @ JCU Townsville

## What's this repo?

I am currently a student at JCU studying a bachelor in Information Technology. This repo is a place for me to
collect and share my work for each week. The projects you see here are assigned to me by my amazing teacher Lindsay.

Lessons I've learned about clean code:

- DRY! Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), a program should not unnecessarily repeat itself unnecessarily.
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), a function should only serve one purpose.
- Pseudocode is very useful for mapping out the logical flow of a program.
