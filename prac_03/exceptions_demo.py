CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

    while denominator == 0:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")

# 1. ValueError occurs when the input does not match the type, in this case
#    if the input is not an integer it will result in a ValueError.
# 2. ZeroDivisionError occurs when the program attempts to divide by 0, which is impossible.
# 3. Yes.
